#This file is shows an example of a very simple way to combine the Rapleaf APIs
#We run a user through the Grap API to get a list of their friends.
#We then run their friends through Person API and aggregate the results. 
#That allows us to get some interesting aggregate stats very easily.
#This particular example gets the average age of their first degree friends
#as well as their average friend count and the number of them that have Twitter accounts
#
#We could very easily run each returned friend back through the Graph API to expand our graph 
#out by one degree before we searched the Person API. This would mean our aggregate stats would 
#cover both first and second degree friends
#
#WARNING: These techniques can burn through queries very quickly. Make sure you know what your
#query limits are.
